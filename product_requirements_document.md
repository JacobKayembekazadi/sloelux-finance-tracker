**Small Business Financial Tracker with Google Sheets Integration**

---

## **Feature Name:** 
Small Business Financial Tracker - Cloud-Native Financial Management Platform

## **Problem Statement:**

Small business owners, particularly those in retail sectors like watch reselling, face significant challenges in tracking their financial performance effectively:

### Current Pain Points:
- **Manual Data Entry**: Business owners spend excessive time on spreadsheet management and data entry
- **Data Fragmentation**: Financial data scattered across multiple tools without centralized view
- **Limited Analytics**: Basic spreadsheets don't provide actionable insights into profitability, ROI, or performance trends
- **Inventory Blindness**: No real-time visibility into inventory levels and their impact on cash flow
- **Poor Decision Making**: Lack of real-time financial metrics leads to uninformed business decisions
- **Accessibility Issues**: Financial data locked on single devices, not accessible for stakeholders
- **Error-Prone Calculations**: Manual calculations for profit margins, ROI, and COGS prone to human error

### Business Impact:
- Lost revenue opportunities due to poor inventory management
- Inability to optimize pricing strategies without clear profit margin visibility
- Cash flow issues from lack of expense tracking
- Time waste on manual bookkeeping instead of business growth activities
