# Alternative Approach: Google Forms + Sheets Integration

Since the Google Sheets API requires OAuth2 for write operations (which is complex for a simple app), here's a simpler approach:

## Option 1: Google Forms Integration (Recommended)

1. **Create a Google Form** linked to your Google Sheet:
   - Go to https://forms.google.com
   - Create a new form with fields: Date, Amount, Type, Quantity, Description
   - In responses, link it to your existing Google Sheet
   - Get the form's "pre-filled link" for programmatic submissions

2. **Benefits**:
   - ✅ No OAuth2 complexity
   - ✅ Direct integration with Google Sheets
   - ✅ Works with API keys for reading data
   - ✅ Automatic data validation

## Option 2: Read-Only Mode with Manual Entry

Keep the current setup but use it as a read-only dashboard:
- Manually enter data in Google Sheets
- App displays real-time analytics and charts
- Perfect for viewing/analyzing existing financial data

## Option 3: Local Storage with Export

- Store data locally in browser
- Export to CSV for Google Sheets import
- Simple and works offline

## Option 4: Full OAuth2 Implementation

- More complex but allows full CRUD operations
- Requires user login with Google account
- Best for production applications

Which approach would you prefer? I recommend Option 1 (Google Forms) for the best balance of functionality and simplicity.
